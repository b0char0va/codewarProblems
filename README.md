1) Given two arrays of strings a1 and a2 return a sorted array r in lexicographical order of the strings of a1 which are substrings of strings of a2.
   
   #Example 1: 
   a1 = ["arp", "live", "strong"]
   
   a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]
   
   returns ["arp", "live", "strong"]
   
   #Example 2: 
   a1 = ["tarp", "mice", "bull"]
   
   a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]
   
   returns []
   
2) Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized. <br/>
3) Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (compSame(a, b) in Clojure) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities. "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order. <br/>
4) Build Tower by the following given argument: number of floors (integer and always greater than 0).
  #Example : 3 floor tower
   [<br/>
    '  *  ',<br/>
    ' *** ',<br/>
    '*****'<br/>
  ]
5) Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.<br/>
